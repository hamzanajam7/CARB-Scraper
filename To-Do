# CARB Scraper + Chatbot

**Timebox:** ~2 hours

## Overview

You will build:

1. A crawler that ingests California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations starting from a single entry URL.
2. A local chatbot interface that allows a user to query the scraped data.

The system must capture document content and the relationships between documents, and expose both through the chatbot.

We care about:

- What you can do with a limited amount of time
- Your ability to reason about structure
- Your system design decisions

---

## Starting Point

Use the following link as your root

- [https://shared-govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I789FF3B05A1E11EC8227000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)](https://shared-govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I789FF3B05A1E11EC8227000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default))

You should begin with a single link and discover the rest programmatically.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Crawl the Site

Your solution must:

- Crawl all regulation pages reachable from the starting link
- Collect and store:
    - All discovered links (including titles for the links)
    - Every document’s title
    - Every document’s main content (you choose the format)
- Capture the relationships between the pages

---

### 2. Store the Data

Your system should store:

- Links
- Titles
- Content
- Relationships between pages

You may choose any storage approach

---

### 3. Chatbot Interface (Required)

Build a local chatbot interface that allows a user to:

- Ask questions about document content
    - Example: “What does regulation X say about emissions limits?”
- Ask questions about relationships
    - “What is the parent of X?”
    - “What are the children of Y?”
    - “Where does this document sit in the hierarchy?”
    - “Show the path from the root to Z.”

The chatbot must use the scraped data as its source of truth.

You choose the user interface

## Deliverables

15 minute demo of the result

Explain your design decisions

## Technical Setup (Suggested)

You may use any language / frameworks

- Use a local IDE
- Consider `uv` for environment management
- Recommend installing and using Playwright (for JS-rendered content)

You are free to use other tooling if preferred

Good luck!
